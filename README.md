## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Understanding and Using REST APIs](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/) - When I initially learned how to use an API this was the resource I used.
- [Page Must Have One Main Landmark](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/html/4.3/landmark-one-main?application=axeAPI) - Helped me understand why I was getting an accessibility error from Frontend Mentor.
- [Introducing the CSS Cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade) - Not directly relevant to the project, but I recommended reading through how styles are cascaded if you don't already understand it.
